            <h1>Road Traffic Accidents in India: Issues and Challenges</h1>
            <h3>The main aim of this paper is to analyze the road accidents 
              in India at national,
               state, and metropolitan city level.</h3>
            <div class="art"><img src="./images/pa.jpg" width="100%"></div>
            <p>Analysis shows that the distribution of road accidental 
              deaths and injuries in India varies according to age, gender,
               month and time. Age group 30-59 years is the most vulnerable
                population group, though males face higher level 
              of fatalities and injuries than their female counterparts.</p>

            <h1>On the challenges to road safety in India</h1>
            <h3>What does the ‘India Status Report on Road Safety 2024’ 
              state with respect to meeting 
              international goals of reducing road accident fatalities?</h3>
            <div class="art"><img src="./images/pv.jpg" width="100%"></div>
            <p>The “India Status Report on Road Safety 2024,”
               prepared by the TRIP Centre at IIT Delhi, not only 
               highlights India’s slow progress toward meeting 
               international goals of reducing road accident fatalities,
                but also emphasises the organic connection between road
                 construction, mobility, and the need for 
              a differentiated approach to mitigate road accidents.</p>
